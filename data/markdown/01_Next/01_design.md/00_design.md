I designed Saoirse without being a designer. I tried my best to make it look nice. But if you do not like the design, you can change anything you want. Since Saoirse is written in Gatsby you have full power over how the course should look like. If that is important to you, I suggest you hire a web developer. Feel free to contact me if you need any help.
