Saoirse is a little side project of mine. If you want to contribute to the project, there are different options:

## Use it and give me feedback

I am happy to hear your feedback: positive and negative. Tell me what works for you, where you face problems and what else you need to make better e-learning products. You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-burkhart/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Christi58451746) and my [personal homepage](https://christianburkhart.de/).

## Add features, improve the webpage

If you are a web developer and like the project, feel free to play around with the code and write a [pull request](https://github.com/ch-bu/saoirse/pulls). What Saoirse currently misses:

* Some animations that would make the product smoother
* More e-learning components that make the product more versatile
* SCORM compatibility. This would be a killer feature

## Improve the design

I am not a designer by training. If you are and have some suggestions, drop me a message or write a [pull request](https://github.com/ch-bu/saoirse/pulls).
