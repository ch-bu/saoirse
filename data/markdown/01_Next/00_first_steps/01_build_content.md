Next, you build the content. I would suggest you do not directly start with Saoirse. Write down the structure of your document in a Word document or a long markdown document. Revise and improve the structure and only start to write the markdown files when you are sure how the course will look like. This procedure will you save some headaches and extra work along the way.
