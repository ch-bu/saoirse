Saoirse is not a framework, which takes over the didactic decisions for you. Saoirse helps you to develop e-learning courses quickly and efficiently. So when you start to develop a course, you should first:

## Define your learning goals

Have a clear idea of what your students are supposed to know and be able to do at the end of your course. Everything should be aligned with these learning objectives. For example,

* After the course, students should be able to develop a simple web page with HTML and CSS
* After the course, students should be able to explain the concept of natural selection in their own words.
* After the course, students should be able to distinguish reptiles from mammals.


## Think about common problems students should be able to solve

A lot of e-learning is boring. Boring because most developers have a wrong metaphor of learning in their heads. Their metaphor is **knowlege telling**. In this metaphor, students are boxes to be filled. As a result, students are flooded with content and don't even know why they need it. 

That's why realistic problems are very helpful. Problems allow learners to see why something is important. Problems help you as a developer to think about the skills and knowledge learners need to solve these problems. And problems are fun. Learners want to engage in learning with effort. Don't make it too easy for them to skip the content. They will if you allow them to.

> Define a set of realistic problems you expect students to be able to solve at the end of the course

The problems should be solvable with some guidance on your part. As students progress make the problems more complicated. We want to establish long-lasting knowledge in the students, that's why at the end of the course, they should be able to solve problems by themselves.

Here is a set of problems that could be assigned for a course on the topic of HTML and CSS:

* Build a small webpage that displays your name in a header and your birthday in a paragraph.
* Change the visual appearance of an existing webpage according to a pre-defined color scheme.
* Build a landing page from a given sketch.
* Build a personal blog with an about page and a portfolio page.

For each problem think about what your learners need to know to solve the problem. Then, design instructions to teach them these things. Use activities like single-choice questions to let them think about the content. Mind that questions are not the same as problems. Questions such as single-choice questions are well-defined, problems are ill-defined.
