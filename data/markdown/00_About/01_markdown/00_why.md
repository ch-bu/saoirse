## Because it is simple

Markdown is great because it is simple. Many e-learning developers write content in Word, PowerPoint or GoogleDocs. These tools are great, but they also get you distracted when you want to concentrate on content. With markdown files you do not worry about styles at all. You just write content and then use Saoirse to do all the heavy lifting buildling the course.

## Because markdown is the language of the web

Markdown is the markup language of the web. Since its syntax is so easy, you can convert markdown documents to all sorts of other documents. With [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) for example you can convert any markdown file in a pdf, Word document or webpage. This gives us the opportunity to seperate the content from the style. If you are working with excellent designers you can improve Saoirse's visual experience by changing the projects HTML and CSS without even touching the markdown files. 

## Use a good editor

The easiest way to write markdown files is by using a good editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Some editors have the ability to live preview your files. This makes developing the content even more fun.
