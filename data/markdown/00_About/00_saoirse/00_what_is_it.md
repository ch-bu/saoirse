> Saoirse is a free and open source e-learning framework that helps e-learning developers to build e-learning courses fast and with a focus on content. 

## Content first

As a e-learning developer we want to be able to develop courses quick and efficiently. That's I have build Saoirse. You simply write all your content in [markdown files](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and convert these files into a full-fledged e-learning course. 

## Based on Gatsby

Saoirse is build on top of [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Gatsby is a blazing fast static site generator. Hence, since Saoirse is just a static webpage, Saoirse fully modifiable. Build your own custom designed courses if you will.
